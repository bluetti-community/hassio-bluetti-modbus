"""Probe a Balco 260 for Modbus registers it is not documented to have.

Reads, one field at a time, registers outside BLUETTI's official Balco 260
list and reports which ones answer with data, which read as zero, and which
the device rejects. Strictly read-only (FC 0x03 only). Two families:

- The EP2000 blocks (summary-ext, per-phase, der-status, ems-control,
  battery-control): every register bluetti-registers declares for EP2000 but
  not for Balco 260. Probed on a real Balco 260 on 2026-09-14: all 57 came
  back "illegal data address". Kept here to re-run after a firmware update.
- The internal-v2 block: the device's own internal register space - the one
  the BLUETTI app speaks over BLE ("ProtocolAddrV2", tabulated from app
  v3.0.9 by https://github.com/mikemccllstr/voltkeeper). The Modbus TCP
  slave demonstrably translates documented writes into that space (a Write
  Single Register to 57016 is confirmed at 2022 - see bluetti-modbus's
  BluettiDevice.write); this block asks whether it also *serves* that space
  to a TCP client. Six of its entries are settings whose values are known
  through documented registers (2022 <-> 57016 and so on), so the script
  reads both and prints them side by side: matching values would mean the
  internal space is reachable, and every other entry becomes worth reading;
  "illegal data address" on all of them closes the question. Probed on a
  real Balco 260 on 2026-09-16: all 54 came back "illegal data address" -
  the slave translates documented writes into that space but does not
  serve it. Kept for the same reason as the EP2000 blocks. Only readable
  registers are listed - the app's write-only ones (control events, power
  off, factory reset, OTA start) are left out even though FC 0x03 could not
  trigger them.
- The balco-set block (opt-in, --blocks balco-set): not unexplored at all -
  one register from each block of BLUETTI's own BalcoXX register list, plus
  its five writable registers. For a device that is in the Balco family but
  is not a Balco 260 (a Balco Transfer Hub, a Balco 500), it maps which of
  the documented blocks the firmware actually serves, one safe request per
  block, before anyone points a full Balco 260 profile at it. A Transfer Hub
  (2026-09-17) answered a single-register read of an unserved address with
  silence rather than the Balco 260's "illegal data address", so on such a
  device run this with --max-timeouts 0: every timeout is still followed by
  a reconnect and a liveness check, which stops the run on its own if the
  device really has stopped answering.
- The pack-41 block (opt-in, --blocks pack-41): the app addresses battery
  packs of 2nd-generation IoT home systems at Modbus slave 41 and up. Over
  TCP, packs are documented at slave 2..N and the aggregate summary at 250,
  so this is a long shot; an unknown slave id most likely times out, which
  the recovery below handles.
- The inv-31, pack-91 and pack-92 blocks (opt-in): the app's own slave ids
  for a balcony system (app 3.1.4, ConnConstantsV2: DC/DC at 1, inverter at
  31, packs at 91 and up) - not the home-system ids the pack-41 block tries.
  Each reads a documented register (50002, 51219, 51221) plus one internal
  pack address at that slave id, so the answer separates "the slave routes
  documented registers per unit" from "it serves the internal pack space
  there": on a Balco 260 whose packs 2 and up read as zero at the documented
  slave ids (bluetti-modbus#55), a pack answering at 91 would be the lead.

Requires only the library the integration already uses:

    pip install "modbus-connection[tmodbus]"

Run it from a machine on the same LAN as the device:

    python3 probe_unexplored_registers.py --host 192.168.1.50

Before running, disable the Bluetti Modbus integration entry in Home
Assistant (or stop anything else polling the device): the Balco 260 accepts
very few simultaneous Modbus TCP connections, and a second poller is the
known way to get its Modbus stack stuck.

What "safe" means here, and why each guard exists:

- One *register* per request, never a multi-register read of an unknown
  address. Confirmed on a real Balco 260 (2026-09-14, 11 unknown fields):
  every 1-register read of an unserved address came back as a clean
  "illegal data address" exception, and every 2-register read of one got
  no reply at all (a timeout, with the device otherwise alive) - the same
  behaviour behind the AC500's isolated-block read plan. So a multi-word
  field is read word by word here and reassembled (--batched restores the
  single request, to reproduce that timeout deliberately).
- Requests are paced (--delay) through modbus-connection's own
  message_spacing, and the connection is kept open for the whole run - a
  fresh connection per read is the pattern that has made this device
  unresponsive under load before.
- A timeout or a corrupted reply is treated as "the link may be stuck": the
  link is dropped, re-opened after --recover-delay, and a known-good
  register (50001, Number of Inverters) is re-read to confirm the device is
  still answering. After --max-timeouts of those in a row the run stops
  rather than keep hammering the device.
- "Illegal data address" is the benign, expected answer for a register the
  firmware doesn't serve, and just gets recorded.

Nothing here writes to the device.
