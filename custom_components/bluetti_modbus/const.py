# component, get_rpc_device_info()/via_device_id), rather than dumping all 31

# d_status (55111) decodes to a bool already (bluetti_modbus_lib's

# instead of sensor.py, which only handles numeric/enum/string values.

# b_soc_low/b_soc_high (57016/57017): battery empty/full SOC thresholds,
# 0-100% - genuinely user-configurable settings, not readings. Routed to
# number.py instead of sensor.py, but only where bluetti_modbus_lib actually
# marks the field writable=True (currently Balco260 only - see that
# library's import.py) - sensor.py falls back to its normal read-only

# fed into DeviceInfo (serial_number/sw_version) instead of shown as plain
# sensors. Matches bluetti-home-assistant's identical fix for the same
# three fields (there they're excluded outright since a cloud-known serial
# already covers d_serial's role; there is no such other source here, so
# d_serial's own decoded value is what DeviceInfo.serial_number uses).
