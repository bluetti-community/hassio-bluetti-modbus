class BluettiModbusClient:
    """A device behind a connection this client owns - for the CLI and standalone use.

    Three transports, one of which must be named:

    - **Modbus TCP** (the default): ``host`` and ``port``.
    - **Modbus/TLS**: the same, with ``tls=True`` and the certificate
      options below.
    - **Modbus RTU over a serial line**: ``serial_device`` instead of a
      host, with ``baudrate``, ``parity``, ``stopbits`` and ``bytesize``.
      The device is a port path (``/dev/ttyUSB0``, ``COM3``) or any URL
      pyserial understands - ``socket://192.168.1.50:8899`` for a
      serial-to-TCP gateway, an ESP32 or a hardware bridge, where the line
      settings live in the gateway rather than here.

    ``unit_id`` selects the Modbus address to talk to (1 by default). On a
    shared RS485 bus that is how the device is picked; over TCP the BLUETTI
    devices answer at 1 and nothing else should be addressed on the
    AC500/EP500Pro family (see this library's README).

    ``message_spacing`` (seconds) is the minimum gap the backend leaves
    between requests. A serial line needs the RTU inter-frame gap, which
    the backend derives from the line speed - state it here only to pace a
    device further apart than that.

    Modbus/TLS options, ``modbus_connection.ModbusTlsParams``':

    - ``verify``: ``True`` checks the server certificate against the system
      store, a path names the CA file or directory to check against,
      ``False`` skips verification altogether.
    - ``check_hostname``: whether the certificate must name the host; only
      meaningful with verification on.
    - ``client_cert`` / ``client_key`` / ``client_key_password``: the client
      certificate, for a device that requires one.

    BLUETTI's encrypted mode (developer.bluetti.com, "Modbus TCP") is
    exactly this: the device's web page takes a CA certificate, a server
    certificate and its key, and the client authenticates with a
    certificate signed by that CA, on the same port as plain mode (502 by
    default). Both backends handle the link. Example::

        client = BluettiModbusClient(
            "192.168.1.100",
            502,
            "ep500p",
            tls=True,
            verify="ca.pem",
            check_hostname=False,
            client_cert="client.pem",
            client_key="client.key",
        )
        values = await client.read()
        await client.aclose()

    And over a serial line, a USB adapter or a gateway::

        client = BluettiModbusClient(device_type="ep2000", serial_device="/dev/ttyUSB0")
        client = BluettiModbusClient(
            device_type="ep2000", serial_device="socket://192.168.1.50:8899"
        )
