# The address a BLUETTI device echoes in a Write Single Register confirmation
# is not the Modbus address that was written to but the same setting's
# address in the device's own internal register space - the one the BLUETTI
# app speaks ("ProtocolAddrV2" in the app's code, tabulated by
# https://github.com/mikemccllstr/voltkeeper/blob/main/docs/source/protocol/modbus-registers.md
# from app v3.0.9). The Modbus TCP slave evidently translates the write to
# an internal one and builds the confirmation from that, so a strict Modbus
# client sees a confirmation that doesn't match its request. That internal
# space differs between product families - a Balco 260 confirms its AC
# output switch at 2011, an AC200L2 its DC output switch at 3008, nowhere
# near the 2012 the Balco family's map would predict - so the table is
# keyed by device class name, then by the Modbus holding-register address
# written to, and holds only captured echoes: every Balco 260 entry from
# 2026-09-16 (all five of its writable registers), the AC200L one from
# 2026-09-18 (bluetti-modbus#78), the EP500P one from 2026-09-20 (its
# owner's first toggles in Home Assistant, hassio-bluetti-modbus#122) -
# the same 3008 as the AC200L2, the portable stations sharing one internal
# map. A device or register with no entry gets its echo accepted and
# reported - see BluettiDevice.write.

# coordinator errors, meaning both the original attempt and that one retry
# failed back to back. Confirmed backend-independent (both tmodbus and
# pymodbus observe the same truncated-frame pattern, just classify it

        Two things are retried here, both confirmed transient on real
        hardware rather than assumed:

        - Codes 5/6 (acknowledge / server device busy) mean the device
          accepted the request but wants more time - seen in practice on
          registers that otherwise read fine, so it's transient device
          behavior, not a permanently bad address. Retried once.
        - A corrupted/truncated reply - ModbusProtocolError under tmodbus
          (bluetti-community/bluetti-modbus#29), or the same event
          classified as ModbusTimeoutError under pymodbus, which can't tell
          a corrupted reply apart from no reply at all. Persistent-connection
          testing against real Balco260/S Meter hardware (both backends)
          showed this recovers cleanly on a following read on the same
          connection in the large majority of cases, with no reconnect
          needed - so an immediate retry here avoids losing the whole poll
          cycle to what is, in practice, usually a one-off glitch. Retried
          up to ``_TRANSIENT_RETRY_COUNT`` times (see its own docstring for
          why this isn't just one any more). If every one of those retries
          still hits the same kind of error, that's no longer "a one-off
          glitch" - retrying further on the same connection can't help a
          link the device's own Modbus TCP stack has gotten stuck on (this
          stack is known to become unresponsive under load - see
          ``BluettiModbusClient.read``'s own comment). The connection is
          dropped right before this last failure is raised, so whichever
          request follows (a caller's own outer retry, or simply the next
          poll cycle) opens a fresh one instead of repeating into the same
          stuck link.

        Anything else (e.g. an illegal address/function code) is a permanent
        condition retrying can't fix, and is not retried here - callers that
        want a hard failure to surface immediately for any reason should call
        ``async_update()`` directly instead.

        A device that is still busy after this one retry raises the bare
        AcknowledgeError/ServerDeviceBusyError, not wrapped into
        BluettiModbusConnectionError like every other failure here - "busy
        twice in a row" is a real, distinct signal from "the connection is
        broken" that a caller may want to tell apart.
