# A write counterpart to bluetti-modread, after the bluetti-modwrite
# Patrick762 shipped in his own bluetti-modbus-lib (25bb444, 2026-09-13):
# same flags (-c/-p/-t/-f/-v), so anyone coming from there does not have
# to relearn the command.
#
# Built on the same pieces as bluetti-modread (see its own comment), with
# one addition that matters: the write goes through BluettiDevice.write(),
# never the Component's own. That override is what absorbs a confirmation
# the device echoes at its internal register address - a strict client
# reports it as a protocol error even though the write applied - and what
# records the echo per device. Bypassing it would turn every successful
# write on a Balco-family device into a failure.

# The AC output switch: on a FridgePower it powers the fridge, on any
# device it can cut whatever the AC outlets feed. Same guard as
# script/write_probe.py - a deliberate flag, not a prompt to click
# through.
